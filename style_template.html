    <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> <strong>Objective:</strong> The student will evaluate his or her online presence based on criteria for responsible technology use and social networking.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>If so, congratulations!</em>

    <p>
    <p>
    <em>If not, take some time to review your social network sites to determine what message you are sending. Be sure to review all aspects of your online footprint with a critical eye (e.g., personal sites, comments made on other sites, comments people make on materials, pages liked or followed, and photos posted). Use the “Social Networking Site Evaluation” worksheet posted in the activity to make notes about any thoughts or questions you may have.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>After you’ve had some time to look through your social networking sites, ask a family member or friend to use the worksheet to conduct a similar review. Ideally, this person will be someone who can provide a very critical review based on experience in work or educational environments.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Get together to compare notes and go over the reviews. Discuss together any issues or concerns that emerged regarding your online presence, along with what can be done to correct these issues. If no areas need to be addressed, discuss the good safety practices you already use online.</em>
