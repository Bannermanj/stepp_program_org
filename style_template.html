Te  achers vs. Professors: There is a reason that college instructors are generally called professors instead of teachers. In high school, your teachers were responsible for directly teaching you things and making sure that you learned them. That’s why they’re called teachers. To “profess” something means to declare or announce it. In college, the professor is only responsible for announcing the information. It’s up to you as the student to actually do what it takes to learn it. That’s why they’re called professors.
