  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p><i class="fa fa-eye"></i> <strong>Objective:</strong> The student will develop a schedule that demonstrates an effective balance of academic and social life in the college setting, including class time, study time, and budgeted time for social, health/wellness, and daily living priorities.
  </p>
  <p>
  <em>This lesson is designed to help you maintain a focus on academic priorities. Academic work is a top priority for successful first-year college students.  This module will ask how to consider 4 goal areas – academic, social, health/wellness, and daily living.  Although each of these areas is important, not all “pieces of the pie” should receive equal amounts of time.</em>

  <div class="info_box">
  <p>
  Take out your goal setting sheets that you started in Module 2, Part 1.  What goals did you set for yourself?
  </p>
  <p>
  You have set goals in four different categories:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Academics</li>
    <li>Daily Living</li>
    <li>Social</li>
    <li>Health/Wellness</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Do you have more goals in one category than in the others? Which one?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Which category do you think will require more goals for college students?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  You will probably have many more NON‐academic goals than academic goals. The goal‐setting worksheet places equal emphasis on each of the four types of goals so that you realize that you need to set goals in every area of your life, not just the academic area. However, in this lesson, you will be guided to understand that for successful college students, academics are generally the biggest “piece of the pie,” so to speak.  You will learn to create a balanced schedule that includes time for all areas, but focuses on academic priorities.

    <h1>Have you accomplished today’s objective?</h1>
   <p>
   <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> <strong>Objective:</strong>  The student will develop a schedule that demonstrates an effective balance of his/her academic and social life in the college setting, including class time, study time, and budgeted time for social, health/wellness, and daily living priorities.
   </p>
   <p>
     <em> If so, congratulations!</em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>If not, review the sample balanced schedule and revise the schedule for Annie to reflect a balance of activities. Have your parent review this with you.  Also work on revising your schedule for the upcoming week to reflect a balance of activities.</em>
