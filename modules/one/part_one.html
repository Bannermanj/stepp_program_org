        <h1>High School</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>Graduation requirements are similar for all students. Students are not responsible for knowing what classes to take.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
      High school requirements are determined by the state’s standards and the student’s track (i.e., technical, college prep, etc.). 
    </p>
    <p>
      The student’s teachers, guidance counselors, and other school administrators are responsible for knowing which classes students must take and for enrolling them in those classes.
    </p>
    <p>
       College requirements vary tremendously among different majors. Many schools have a basic foundation curriculum that all students must complete, usually consisting of several
courses in English, social sciences, science, math, humanities, fine arts, and health/exercise. However, even within these requirements, there is often significant flexibility. Once a student completes the foundations courses, each major, minor, and concentration has different requirements and options.
    </p>
    <p>
    A student’s advisor will help to determine which courses are required, but the ultimateresponsibility for keeping up with the requirements and completing the degree progra lies with the student. Advisors generally only provide input and guidance.

  <h2>Environment</h2>

        </ul>
      </div>

        <ul>

  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    This is a critical difference between high school and college, and many first-year students who have difficulty do not realize that the responsibility for their learning now lies solely with them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Many professors are willing to go the extra mile with students to make sure that they are learning the information. However, it is the student’s responsibility to learn and seek out the professor’s help when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Professors are generally going to assume that students are learning what is being presented, unless the student tells them otherwise.

      Some students understand this point better when given this explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
Teachers vs. Professors: There is a reason that college instructors are generally called professors instead of teachers. In high school, your teachers were responsible for directly teaching you things and making sure that you learned them. That’s why they’re called teachers. To “profess” something means to declare or announce it. In college, the professor is only responsible for announcing the information. It’s up to you as the student to actually do what it takes to learn it. That’s why they’re called professors.

  <h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>

  <div class="comparision_wrapper">

        <h1>High School</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>Accommodations granted by a student’s IEP are designed to <strong>ensure the student's success</strong> in meeting academic and IEP (or 504) goals.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="right_column">
        <h1>College</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>Accommodations granted by Disability Support Services are designed to ensure that a student has equal access to a college education, but <strong>do not guarantee the student's success</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="info_box">
  <p>
Services for students with disabilities are governed by different laws in high school and college.
</p>
<p>
The laws that govern high school basically guarantee that students with a disability must be given an education that is appropriate for them based on their abilities. The focus is on monitoring student performance and student success.
</p>
<p>
The laws that govern college students with disabilities guarantee equal access to the college’s curriculum with reasonable accommodations. However, if students put forth their best effort and work up to their potential in college, they can still fail. Colleges do not make any fundamental changes to modify their curricula or standards for students with disabilities.

  <h1>Independence and Responsibility</h1>

  <div class="comparision_wrapper">
    <div class="comparison_box">
      <div class="left_column">
        <h1>High School</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>Students are usually <strong>told</strong> what to do, <strong>monitored</strong> to ensure that they do it, and <strong>given frequent feedback</strong> on their performance.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="right_column">
        <h1>College</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>Students are expected to <strong>take responsibility</strong> for <strong>finding out</strong> what to do and how to do it, <strong>accomplish necessary tasks</strong>, and <strong>accept the consequences</strong> of their decisions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
  Incoming first-year students often say that they are looking forward to increased independence. However, it often does not occur to them that along with that independence comes the need to take responsibility for aspects of their education that other people may have supported until now.
    </p>
    <p>
  Students who practice taking initiative, self-monitoring, seeking out feedback, and completing tasks independently in high school are often better prepared for the increased responsibilities of college. That does not mean gradually abandoning all supports (e.g., accommodations) related to having a disability. Students will have access to accommodations in college, but they need to be able to self-advocate for and use those accommodations.
