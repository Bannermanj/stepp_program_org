  <h1>Learn About It</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    College…it might be a distant dream that you are only now beginning to think about.  While it is a long way away, the time to start preparing is now.  Taking the unknown away from the college process can make you see that it is an achievable goal, but there are some things that you need to know specifically about how to receive accommodations. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Receiving accommodations in college is not only your responsibility, it is also a formal process.  It begins with you contacting the office of Disability Support Services or the 504 Coordinator.  It can seem overwhelming, but with the right support and preparation, you will be able to set up the accommodations that you need to be successful.  Each college is a little different in how they process student needs in relation to disabilities.  They might have a different name for the office or coordinator or a slightly different process with different forms.  In spite of the differences, the general process is normally similar in all settings in terms of the order of the steps to take and the person responsible for initiating each step.  Today you are going to look at the typical steps to take with most colleges when deciding to disclose your disability.

    <p>
    Your child is still at an age where he/she needs your support, but before you know it, he/she will be ready to be independent.  After graduation from high school, your child will need to be able to make decisions about self-disclosure and on his/her own.  One thing you can do now is to become knowledgeable of the process and be there to practice that process.  This practice will make your child more comfortable in high school and beyond.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<a name="step-1-contact-dss"></a>
<div class="module_section">
  <h1>Step 1: Contact the Office of Disability Support Services</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <h3>Person Responsible: You</h3>
    <p>
    The very first step begins with YOU contacting the office of Disability Support Services or the comparable office at your college if it has a different name.  You must register as a student with a disability.  If you do not take the initiative to make this appointment, you will not receive accommodations.  Make sure you are prepared when you go. 
    </p>
    <p class="center">
    <strong>You will need current documentation of your disability from a licensed professional.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     IEP’s typically do not qualify as current documentation.  You can check the college’s website to see what they require, or you can ask the person in the office when you call to set up your appointment.
    </p>
  </div>

<div class="module_section">
  <h1>Step 2: Discuss Your Accommodations with the DSS Coordinator</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <h3>Person Responsible: You</h3>
    <p>
    Step two is also your responsibility.  You have to be prepared to talk about 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accommodations you have used in the past</li>
      <li>Why the accommodations worked </li>
      <li>What you think you will need in college</li>
      <li>What has been successful for other students in college</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    By practicing your formal self-disclosure from the previous lesson, you will be much more comfortable in this meeting. 
    </p>
  </div>

<a name="step-3-accommodations"></a>
<div class="module_section">
  <h1>Step 3: DSS Office Determines Your Accommodations</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <h3>Person Responsible: DSS Coordinator</h3>
    <p>
    The person in charge of accommodations (regardless of the title) will review your documentation and determine if you are eligible for services.  If you are eligible, he/she will
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Review your file</li>
      <li>Decide what accommodations you will receive from the college</li>
      <li>Set up a meeting with you</li>
      <li>Give you a letter that you will give to your professors detailing the accommodations for which you qualify</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<a name="step-4-dss-letter"></a>
<div class="module_section">
  <h1>Step 4: Give Your Letter of Accommodations to Your Professors</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <h3>Person Responsible: You</h3>
    <p>
    It is your responsibility to give the accommodation letter to your professors and be prepared to talk with the professor about how to receive your accommodations.  You will want to set up a meeting with your professors during their office hours.  Make sure you do this early in the semester.  You can give the letter to them at any time, but you will want to do it early.  If you wait until midway through the semester, you cannot go back and re-do any tests or assignments.  
    </p>
    <p class="center">
    <strong>The accommodations begin as soon as you give the letter to your professor.</strong>
    </p>
  </div>

<a name="step-5-professors-give-accommodations"></a>
<div class="module_section">
  <h1>Step 5: Professors Provide Accommodations</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    When it comes to providing the accommodations, your professors are responsible.  If you only receive accommodations for tests, you might want to remind them a few days in advance so that they can prepare your accommodations.  Professors are required to keep this information confidential.  If they have any questions that you can’t answer or you don’t feel comfortable answering, direct them to call the DSS office.
    </p>

<a name="step-6-monitor-accommodations"></a>
<div class="module_section">
  <h1>Step 6: Monitor Accommodations</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <h3>Person Responsible: You</h3>
    <p>
    The final step is to monitor the accommodations, and this is your job.  Your professor will not know if they are working or not.  You need to ask yourself these questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are the supports in place are working?</li>
      <li>How do you know? </li>
      <li>Do you need more supports? </li>
      <li>Is there a problem with your accommodations?  If so, contact the DSS office. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<a name="remembering-the-steps"></a>
<div class="module_section">
  <h1>Remembering the Steps</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    Now it’s your turn to see if you remember the order of the steps and who is responsible for taking the first action in each of the steps.  Complete the activity and see how you do!
    </p>
  <!--This is the same as the last two lessons.  The handouts are available to link here (Remembering the Steps for Self-Disclosure), but it would be great if it were an online activity. -->

<a name="meeting-with-your-professor"></a>
<div class="module_section">
  <h1>Part Two: Meeting with Your Professor</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    The 504 or DSS coordinator is trained and has been hired to specifically help students with disabilities.  Your professor, on the other hand, was specifically hired to teach certain content to his/her students.  While you are covered by the law, you do want to make a good first impression on your professor.  You do that by being prepared and professional.  
    </p>
    <p>
    You are not required to share the details of your disability with your professor.  You only need to provide the accommodations for which you qualified.  Additionally, you are not required to meet with every professor.  If you feel confident in one class, but would like accommodations in another, that is perfectly acceptable.

    Read the following scenario.  This student does four things well and makes four mistakes.  Can you spot them?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
  Jerry walks in to the professor’s office a few minutes after their scheduled appointment. “Hi John, sorry I’m late. I do appreciate that you are willing to meet with me.” Jerry looks for his list of questions for Dr. Bagel that he wrote up before the meeting. He opens his notebook and his papers fall on the floor. He then looks in his textbook and finds the folded paper. Then Jerry’s cell phone rings. Jerry apologizes to the professor and looks to see who is calling him. Since it is Jerry’s roommate, he decides to take the quick call. After the phone call, Jerry explains to his professor that he missed class last week and he has heard from his classmates that he missed a pop quiz. Jerry asks Dr. Bagel when he can retake the quiz. Dr. Bagel informs Jerry that he does not let students make up pop quizzes and will have to accept the zero as his quiz grade. Jerry then asks if he missed anything else important that day. Dr. Bagel informs him that all of his lectures are important and should not be missed. Before Jerry leaves, Dr. Bagel tells Jerry that after he gets the missed class notes from a classmate and reads the related chapter, to come back to his office if he has any specific questions about the material, as he’d be happy to clarify the information. Jerry thanks the professor for his help and leaves saying “I am really enjoying your class.”

    Your child can start practicing these behaviors with other adults, including you, now.  In everyday conversations, start bringing these behaviors to light.  Set up opportunities for practice.  Then point out what your child is doing well, and practice on the areas that are weak.
