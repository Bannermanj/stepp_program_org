    <h2>Benefits of Diversity</h2>
    <strong>Diversity helps develop worldly knowledge</strong>
    <p>
      Diversity helps develop knowledge of the world and its cultures. College might be the first time students have the opportunity to have real interactions with people from diverse groups. Not only is the student population diverse, but so is the faculty and staff. Instead of being reserved or avoiding people who are different from them, students should embrace this opportunity to learn more about different cultures and customs of the world as well as teach other people about their own culture and traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worldly knowledge doesn’t necessarily have to mean knowledge of different countries. Some students have never traveled outside their state or even their region. Worldly knowledge, to these students, might mean getting to know someone from a big city if they are from a rural area, or getting to know someone from another part of the United States. For some students, worldly knowledge might include interacting with a person from a different religion.
    </p>
    <strong>Diversity improves social growth</strong>
    <p>
      Interacting with others helps widen your social network. This, in turn, helps you to develop relationships with others whom you may not have associated with in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      It takes effort to reach out to people who are different from you. Many high schools have cliques of people who stay with their own group. When students go to college, they may find it easiest to gravitate toward people who are similar to them. But they will have many opportunities to get to know people who have different interests, and who they would never have “hung out with” in high school. This widens their social growth and opens their eyes to the intrinsic value of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is danger in never taking the time to get to know people with different interests, likes, and dislikes.
    </p>
    <strong>Diversity prepares students for future work environments</strong>
    <p>
      Diversity prepares students for real world work environments. Success in today’s dynamic workforce requires sensitivity to others’ differences. It doesn’t matter what career path you take, you will be working with employers, coworkers, and clients from diverse backgrounds from across the globe. When you experience diversity in college, you will begin to lay the groundwork to be comfortable working with individuals from all populations. How you relate to people from different backgrounds also needs to be considered for success.
    </p>
    <strong>Diversity encourages innovative thinking</strong>
    <p>
      Networking with others who are unlike us helps us think outside of our own “box” (prior experiences, knowledge, skill set, etc.). When you begin your college career, you will "think harder" as you are presented with new material. The same will happen as you interact with different groups of people. Exposure to diversity increases your ability to view issues or problems from various angles. People from various backgrounds bring different background knowledge and therefore a different approach to situations, problems, and circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of always thinking that our way is best and right, we can learn from other people and gain wisdom from witnessing alternative solutions and mindsets. These angles will work to your benefit when you are presented with problems in complex situations. Be encouraged to expand your views and think of multiple options when making decisions. Remember your own views, for example regarding ethics and morals.
    </p>
    <strong>Diversity increases self-advocacy</strong>
    <p>
      Self-advocacy is the ability to effectively assert your needs and preferences and to make your own decisions. When you are around people who are different from you, your eyes are opened to ideas and opinions that are different from your own. This provides you the opportunity to decide for yourself why you do the things you do, believe the things you believe, and say the things you say. College is the time in your life when you go from doing what your family, peer group, or community has always told you to do, to deciding for yourself who you will be. Being around diverse people can help with this transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learn from others and sharpen your self-knowledge and insight by comparing and contrasting your life experiences with those of others.

      Research a college or university campus that you are interested in attending. Find out what types of diversity programs it offers. Remember to look at topics such as clubs and organizations, majors, study abroad, multicultural programs, and others.
