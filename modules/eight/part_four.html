    When living in close quarters with someone, it is important to get started on the right foot. Roommate selection, communication, and building a positive relationship are three issues that college students need to consider as they prepare to live with someone other than a family member.

    <p>
      The first step in the process of living with a roommate in college is generally deciding who to live with. Some colleges give incoming students more choice and allow them to select their own roommates. They may have the option of requesting to room with someone they already know or someone they are “randomly” assigned to live with by the housing staff (although those assignments may or may not actually be random). Some colleges also offer the opportunity to pair up with another student who will be living on campus through some type of web-based system or social media platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Going Potluck” is a common term used by students who decide to move in with someone they do not know. In this situation, students need to be open-minded and remember that they could be matched with anyone—someone who has a lot in common with them, or someone who is drastically different in many ways. Regardless of how similar or different this person is, you may end up living with your future best friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the college, students who go “potluck” may be matched randomly with another student of the same gender who has requested the same dorm, or matched based on lifestyle factors that the college asks about on a roommate questionnaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this situation, just as in any roommate situation, the roommate relationship could end up being “a match made in heaven” or “like oil and water” or anywhere in between. It’s important to remember that knowing your roommate ahead of time isn’t a guarantee that it will end up going well. Although many incoming freshmen are scared away from random roommate assignments by horror stories told by their older friends or siblings, plenty of students who go potluck end up having a strong roommate relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no standard right or wrong answers to roommate selection questions. Each student is different and should take his or her own preferences and needs into account when determining what roommate situation will likely be the best. Each approach has pros and cons. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Living with someone you don’t know (who is assigned by the housing office) provides an opportunity to expand your social circle and start making connections with new people from the very beginning of college. It also allows you to live with a person who doesn’t have any preconceived notions about you, which is perfect if you’re craving a fresh start and a chance to break out of social roles you may have played in high school. However, it requires you to get to know this person from scratch, which might take longer and require more direct communication to develop mutually acceptable roommate routines.</li>
      <li>Living with a close friend means that you’ll already know a lot about this person’s personality, preferences, and habits. You know how you’re compatible and where you might have friction or tension. It can also be comforting to know that you’ll have a built-in social support in your room. However, a pre-existing friendship can come with other pre-existing issues as well. Some people can be great friends but make terrible roommates simply because they differ on key issues that only matter when they’re sharing close quarters. It can also be awkward because a disagreement with your roommate will automatically mean that you’re also at odds with a part of your social support system, which you might otherwise have gone to for support in such a situation.</li>
      <li>Living with someone you know, but who isn’t necessarily a close friend, can include pros and cons from both of these other categories.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Be aware of the adjustment period that will need to take place in the beginning, and don’t be too hasty to switch roommates after the first week. With any roommate relationship, it will take a few weeks for each of you to learn about the other’s quirks, habits, and schedules and to find a way to relate without driving each other crazy. Finding someone you can successfully cohabit with leads to a much more pleasant living arrangement, provided that you and your roommate have similar expectations and mutual respect.

  <h1>Communicating with Your Roommate</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
      Once you’ve been paired with a roommate, communicating with that person is the next step in the process of establishing a relationship. The most important part of living with someone else is effective communication! Communicating effectively with your roommate will lay a foundation for your roommate relationship. The way you communicate will determine how you handle conflicts and resolve issues together. Because you will be living in such close quarters with this person, some friction is inevitable. The end result of that friction—and whether it leads to a mutually acceptable solution or a huge argument—is largely determined by the way you communicate with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the best initial steps is to communicate even before you move in together. Most housing offices make this easy by giving you your assigned roommate’s email address and/or phone number as soon as you’re matched. It can be awkward to make the initial contact with a stranger, but it’s well worth it. Start by talking about logistics: discussing who is bringing large items that can be shared (e.g., TV, DVD player, futon) so you won’t end up with duplicates, talking about when you’re each planning to arrive, and so on. This conversation begins the process of getting to know each other, which can help you feel like you aren’t living with a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following tips will ease communication between roommates.
    </p>
    <h3>Set ground rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Many college housing offices encourage (or require) roommates to create a “roommate contract” during the first week or two of the semester.</li>
      <li>Roommate contracts open up the avenues of communication between roommates on key topics that have the potential to cause friction when two people are living in close quarters.</li>
      <li>Examples include quiet hours, when guests can be in the room, what items are shared or not shared, acceptable noise levels, temperature of the room, reasonable number of times to snooze an alarm clock, how often to clean, etc.</li>
      <li>Work with your roommate (and get assistance from your RA) to create a roommate contract that meets the needs of and respects the preferences of both people.</li>
      <li>Even if you think some of the issues listed on your roommate contract may never become a problem, it’s better to have them documented from the beginning anyway. The contract can always be revised if needed, and it will give you something to reference if something unexpectedly becomes a source of friction.</li>
      <li>In creating this document, it’s very important to strike a balance between standing your ground on non-negotiable issues and compromising on other issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Compromise</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Compromise is important in any relationship, including a roommate relationship. Living with someone always requires the need to compromise. Even the most compatible roommates will sometimes have differing needs or preferences. The key to successful compromise in these situations is to express your needs and preferences but still respect your roommate’s.</li>
      <li>Learn to identify when it’s time to “give a little” or “give in” vs. when it’s time to “stand your ground.” Both roommates have an equal claim on the shared space of the room, so neither should be giving in or standing your ground significantly more than the other is.</li>
      <li>Negotiating a roommate contract is often the first time when new roommates have to compromise with each other.</li>
      <li><strong>An example of compromise</strong>: You like to blast your music and move around when you study, but your roommate likes dead silence. An easy compromise is for you to wear headphones and for your roommate to wear earplugs. That way, you get to hear your music, and your roommate won’t be able to hear either the music or the sounds of you moving around.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Be straightforward, honest, and trustworthy and establish mutual respect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The best way to earn respect is to be respectful. Start off on the right foot; treat your roommate the way you want to be treated in order to establish a relationship based on mutual respect.</li>
      <li>Develop a consistent system for leaving each other notes and messages to help prevent misunderstandings and conflict. This system can apply to anything from “James stopped by to borrow your psych textbook” to “we’re out of peanut butter, can you pick up more please?” Also, as a safety precaution, it’s always a good idea to let someone know where you are and when you’ll be back. Your roommate is a great person to notify about these things, and it can be as simple as leaving a note in your designated spot saying “spending the night at Morgan’s apartment; back by noon Sunday.” If you have a dry-erase board or bulletin board in your room, you can leave your schedules and other information up there so you’ll know when to expect each other to be around.</li>
      <li>Although leaving each other notes or texting each other is a great method for most communication, sometimes you need to touch base face-to-face. Learn when it’s appropriate to do so. Use your best judgment: as a general rule, if you think the issue will cause conflict, it’s better to talk directly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Be available</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You don’t have to become best friends with your college roommate, but you can set the stage for at least an amicable acquaintanceship by being friendly and taking time to get to know each other.</li>
      <li>•	It’s easy to get wrapped up in other activities and connections, but don’t lose sight of the fact that you and your roommate are also part of each other’s support network in college. If you realize that you rarely see your roommate, take the initiative to connect or reconnect. If your schedules are busy, you might want to set a time to get dinner or coffee together. You might even want to set up a roommate meeting or roommate evening every so often. Whether you do something together or just talk, it’s great to have a designated time when you know you can touch base face-to-face about anything that needs to be discussed.</li>
      <li>•	Be aware of the unspoken messages you’re sending to your roommate through your actions. Are you never around? Do you always have earbuds in when you’re in the room? Do you always sit with your back toward your roommate’s side of the room? If there’s tension in your roommate relationship, it could be related to the subtle messages you’re sending by actions like these. Your roommate might think you’re uninterested in or upset with him or her, even if that isn’t your intention. Your body language can convey whether you’re available or not as well as your words.</li>
      <li>Don’t expect your roommate to be a mind reader. If you’ve never expressed your feelings about an issue, you can’t hold your roommate responsible for not respecting them. This is part of why a roommate contract is so valuable: it gets a lot of these preferences out in the open before they become a point of contention. In addition, don’t expect your roommate to know that you’re upset about something if you’ve been hiding your feelings. Sometimes college students will carry on like everything is fine even though they are furious inside. When they finally boil over—usually due to a small issue (the “straw that broke the camel’s back,” so to speak)—their roommate is completely taken by surprise because they had no outward indication that the other person was angry. Similarly, if you think your roommate might be irritated with you, speak up and find out. You may be able to look at your own actions recently and determine what you might have done. But if you can’t, don’t let the tension fester. It may be uncomfortable to bring up at first, but it’s far better than being caught off guard later on!</li>
      <li>The previous point ties into this one as well: address issues when they’re small. Don’t wait until a dozen things have upset you or until the situation has reached gargantuan proportions. In a non-confrontational way, deal with friction before it boils over into a huge problem. If you handle things when they first come up, you’re more likely to avoid nitpicking or overanalyzing your roommate’s every move. If one thing is bothering you, you may start to focus on everything else that your roommate does that is even slightly different from how you would do it, and view everything he or she does as wrong. This pattern can drive an unnecessary wedge between the two of you.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Practice respectful communication skills before getting to college</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you practice these skills now, they will be second nature by the time you need to use them in your roommate relationship.</li>
      <li>Listen. It’s important not just that you are listening, but that your roommate feels like you are really listening. If you’re talking face-to-face about something important, look at your roommate when they’re talking. Give him or her your undivided attention.</li>
      <li>Think before you speak. It’s very difficult to undo damage created by saying something in anger or haste. Take the time to say what you mean and mean what you say.</li>
      <li>Use respectful language. Nobody likes to feel blamed or accused, and you can convey the same information without resorting to language that will make your roommate feel disrespected and cut off his or her willingness to listen. One way to do this is to state your concerns in the first-person (“I”) instead of second-person (“you”). For example: “I have a hard time concentrating on my homework when there’s a lot of background noise like phone conversations or TV” instead of “You’re making it hard for me to study by watching TV and talking on the phone.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For each key idea or aspect of shared living, ask your student to brainstorm a potential conflict that could arise in a roommate relationship related to that issue. Then, for each potential conflict, ask him or her to describe the steps he or she might take to resolve the conflict and repair the relationship with his or her roommate. Here’s an example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Issue: Sleeping habits</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Potential conflict: </strong>Your roommate finds it easier to fall asleep with the TV on, but you have a hard time falling asleep unless the room is dark and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Potential Solution: </strong>Talk to your roommate about compromising so you can both fall asleep easier. Suggest that you will use a sleep mask to block out the light from the TV if your roommate either uses headphones or watches on mute with the closed captions on. Also, ask if your roommate would be willing to use the sleep timer so the TV will turn off after he or she falls asleep instead of staying on all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      After your student has shared his or her conflict and solution, explore the topic further by brainstorming other possible solutions together.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are first starting out with your new roommate, the old adage “don’t judge a book by its cover” is applicable. Avoid assumptions and snap judgments; instead, take the time to get to know your roommate yourself. Don’t rely on what you hear from other people or what you see on social media.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might be surprised how many people don’t even bother trying to get to know another person or trying to get along with others because they’ve decided from the get-go that they are too different to be compatible. Before even spending one minute in a room together, some students have written off their roommate as “just someone to share space with” because of preconceived notions about their interests, personality, or other factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you don’t agree on many things with your roommate, you can still appreciate the experience as an opportunity for personal growth. Learning to compromise with someone and expand your understanding of other people is a key component of appreciating diversity. Staying open-minded will help you to see the experience in a different light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although you may not end up becoming friends, you and your roommate need to peacefully coexist in a shared space for 9 months. Even roommates who aren’t close can usually find a way to share the space amicably. Being respectful toward your roommate can often go a long way toward encouraging your roommate to be respectful in return.
