    <h3>Definition of Credit</h3>
    <p>
    Credit is the confidence in a person’s ability and intention to pay for something later instead of immediately. A person with good credit can purchase something on credit, receive the item or service immediately, and pay for it over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Credit is basically a loan that has specific repayment terms and conditions. Sometimes this loan is between a person and a bank, as it would be if you purchased a house on credit. Sometimes the loan is between a person and a credit card company, as it would be if you used your Visa card to buy a sweater at a store. Regardless of the specifics, any time you make a purchase that does not require you to give your money to the person providing the item or service immediately, you are making a credit transaction.

      Consider developing a plan for using credit during college. Also consider researching and applying for a credit card. It is a good idea to practice using your credit card and paying off the balance each month before you enter college.
